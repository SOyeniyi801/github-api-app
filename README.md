## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Vanilla Javascript


### What I learned

During this project, I faced challenges with styling, particularly in achieving the desired look for the search bar. However, I was able to learn valuable techniques. I mastered the art of correctly centering a page and effectively listing font family properties with fallback options. Additionally, I gained a deeper understanding of setting global variables for color schemes. Exploring CSS flexbox further tested my skills, and I learned the importance of specificity in CSS, especially when dealing with conflicting rules for the same element. On the JavaScript side, I successfully implemented a toggle for dark mode, honing my skills in dynamic styling using JavaScript.

### Continued development

Moving forward, I aim to delve deeper into working with APIs, particularly focusing on understanding how to extract and display data on the page effectively. I also plan to continue refining my styling skills, as there is always room for improvement and new techniques to explore.
